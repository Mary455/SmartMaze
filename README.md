# Smart Maze
## Literally works in the opposite way of usual mazes!

Unlike ordinary mazes which have some specific barriers and you have to find a barrier-free way to the destination; this game asks **YOU** to determine the coordinates of desired source, destination, and a certain number of barriers. Then it will find the shortest way to reach out from the source towards the destination itself.

This maze is designed for a 20*20 board, but can be easily changed to any board size!
